The Event Loop is like a manager in JavaScript that keeps checking if there is any work to do and decides what should run now and what should wait.

How it works (step by step):

Call Stack → Where JavaScript executes code line by line.
Example: console.log("Hello") goes here first.

Web APIs / Background Tasks → Things like setTimeout, fetch, or event listeners don’t block the main thread.
They are handed over to the browser to handle.

Callback Queue (Task Queue) → Once the background task is finished (like timer completed or data fetched), the result (callback function) is placed in the queue.

Event Loop → Keeps watching:

If Call Stack is empty, it takes the first task from the Queue and pushes it to the Call Stack.

This cycle keeps going forever.

Example:
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside Timeout");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");


Flow:

"Start" → goes to Call Stack → printed.

setTimeout → sent to Web API → waits for 2 sec.

"End" → goes to Call Stack → printed.

After 2 sec → callback goes into Queue.

Event Loop checks → Call Stack empty → moves callback to stack → prints "Inside Timeout".

Output:

Start
End
Inside Timeout


In short:
Event Loop = A cycle that keeps checking if JavaScript can run the next task from the queue.
It makes async things (like timers, API calls) possible even though JS is single-threaded.

Do you want me to also explain it with a real-life example (like restaurant/waiter system) to make it even easier?


console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside Timeout");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");


Flow:

"Start" → goes to Call Stack → printed.

setTimeout → sent to Web API → waits for 2 sec.

"End" → goes to Call Stack → printed.

After 2 sec → callback goes into Queue.

Event Loop checks → Call Stack empty → moves callback to stack → prints "Inside Timeout".
